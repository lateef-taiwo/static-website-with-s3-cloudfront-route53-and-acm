# static-websites
This repository contains two basic AWS projects. 
I used my resume website for demonstrating the two projects.
The first one hosts a static website on S3.
The second entails hosting static websites using S3, CloudFront, Route53 and ACM, these will make the website secured, have a custom domain name, fast and globally available with ultra minimal latency.
